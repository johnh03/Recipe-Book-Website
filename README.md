# super-simple-website
A super simple website using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. This project eventually transformed into a website where the user will be able to post their recipes with a list of ingredients, steps, and an image of their complete dish.

Break down of the project:

Home Page: The users will be able to post their recipes with a name, list of ingredients, as well as step by step instructions. An upload image option is also available.

Signup Page: The user will be able to sign up when pressing the "Login / Singup" button then pressing the "Sign up here" hyper link next to "Don't have an account?". There the user will be able to create a username and password. The username and password are currently being stored in the users local browser. Therefore if the user clears their browser cashe then the account information would be deleted with it.

Login Page: The user will be able to login when pressing the "Login/ Singup" button. Here the user will have to put in their username and password to gain access to their account. Not much has been accomplished with accounts, the future plan is to be able to search for a username and all of their recipes will show up.
